# Work Scheduler

Using jQuery, I've added functionality to the provided documents to create a calendar that saves the user's inputs.

With MomentJS, I was able to get the current time and store it as a variable in the format that best suited this project.
With that, I was able to compare the time of the row to the current time to determine if the row's time was in the past, present, or future.

I also utilized the "localStorage" property and it's methods to make sure that the user's input would persist to the page after refreshing.
